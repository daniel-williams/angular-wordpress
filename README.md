# angular2-wordpress
Angular 2 running against the worlds okayest blog CMS, Wordpress. Currently using the JSON API plugin.

### Motivations
For the most part, I'm still doing a deep dive on angular 2 framework patterns against a blog backend--one of my common use cases. Currently working through component composition strategies.
