# angular2-wordpress
Simple Angular 2 app, running against the worlds okeyest blog CMS, Wordpress. Currently using the JSON API plugin.

### Motivations
I've always liked the Wordpress dashboard, but mostly hate working with community themes/plugins. The never-ending series of compromises displeases me greatly. Of course I could edit the theme/plugin or write my own, but that brings me to the real crux of the matter: everytime I've forced to work with PHP, I feel... diminished. What if I could use Angular or React on the front-end?
